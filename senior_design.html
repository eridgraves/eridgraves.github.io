      <h1>SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT (EE364/EE464)</h1>

      <ul class="posts">
	     <li>Worked in a small team of Electrical Engineering students on a project proposed by an industry sponsor.</li>
       <li>Designed project requirements with an industry mentor, and worked under them during the project.</li>
       <li>Created, documented, and presented a working prototype at the end of the classes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      The industry sponsor for my project was a large, well-known oil services company, who wanted to create an automated system of grading the wear on drill bits used for drilling wells.
      Our solution was developed into a working web application prototype, containing multiple subsystems.
      These included methods to extract objects using a custom-trained machine learning model in TensorFlow, and multiple novel image processing methods for detecting wear and damage to drill bits.
      Despite a limited dataset, our final prototype determined damage and wear with a 86% accuracy when compared to hand-labeled damage.
