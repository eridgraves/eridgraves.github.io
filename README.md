# My Personal Website
## eridgraves.github.io

You can find here information about myself as well as a list of my personal projects with more background information than I give in my github readmes (unless I got busy making new things).   

My web development experience is limited, but this gives me a good place to play around with the programming languages that electrical engineers usually steer clear of. As such, don't expect great code here, I'm learning as I go.

I was inspired to create my website straight from html and css to avoid using a webdev development/deployment framework.
